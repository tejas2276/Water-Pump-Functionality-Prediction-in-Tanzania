# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing and predicting the operational status of water points in Tanzania using machine learning. The goal is to develop a model that can predict whether a water point is functional or non-functional based on various features related to the water point, its location, funding, and other characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about water points in Tanzania, including:
- Training Set Labels: The operational status of each water point, categorized as "functional" or "non-functional".
- Training Set Values: Detailed attributes about each water point, including:
  - Location data (longitude, latitude)
  - Water point characteristics (e.g., water quality, water source)
  - Project-related information (e.g., amount raised, installer, funder)
  - Time-related data (e.g., date recorded)

## Structure
The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. Data Cleaning: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure it's ready for analysis and modeling.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data visually to understand patterns and relationships.
4. Preparation for Modeling: 
   - Factorization and encoding of categorical features.
   - Train-test split for model training and evaluation.
5. Dimensionality Reduction: Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for visualizing the dataset.
6. Baseline Models: Implementing basic machine learning models (KNN, Random Forest, and CatBoost) for initial comparisons.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the models using techniques like grid search or random search.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pump-it-up.git
cd pump-it-up
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook (`Tanzania_Water_Status.ipynb`) to go through the analysis and model training steps. The notebook will guide you through the different sections, from data exploration to model evaluation.
